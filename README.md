Welcome to yet another one of my small projects, this project is a webapp created for the use of the soldiers at Supply base 6013 of the IDF.
<br></br>
**Features:**
* The Structure (A system that allows a user to fully customize the contents of this webapp in order to maintain longevity.)
* The Site-Builder (A system that builds the whole site on runtime based on "The structure".)
